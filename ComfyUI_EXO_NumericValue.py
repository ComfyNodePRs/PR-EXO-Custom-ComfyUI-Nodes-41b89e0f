EXO Numeric Value ðŸ‘‘
-----------------------------
The ComfyUI EXO Numeric Value node is a simple yet essential node for numeric entry within the ComfyUI workflow. It allows users to input a numeric value, outputting it as a float for use in subsequent nodes.

Features:
- Numeric Input: Provides a straightforward interface for entering numeric values, supporting float precision.
- Seamless Integration: Designed to connect easily with nodes that require numeric inputs.

Inputs:
- Numeric_Value: A float input field for entering the desired numeric value.

Outputs:
- Numeric_Value: The entered numeric value, output as a float for use in other nodes.
