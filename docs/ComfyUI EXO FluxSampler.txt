EXO FluxSampler ðŸ‘‘
-----------------------------
The ComfyUI EXO FluxSampler node is an advanced sampling node designed for ComfyUI. It provides flexible and customizable sampling capabilities, allowing for precise control over model sampling.

Features:
- Customizable Sampling: Including noise seed, increment value, sampler name, scheduler, and more.
- Model Sampling: Utilizes a custom ModelSamplingFlux logic.
- Noise Generation: Includes a built-in noise generator.
- Guidance Integration: Supports conditioning guidance.

Inputs:
- Model: The model to be used for sampling.
- Conditioning: The conditioning tensor for guiding the sampling process.
- Width and Height: Dimensions for the output image.
- Noise_Seed: Seed for noise generation, ensuring reproducibility.
- Increment_Value: Increment value for sampling adjustments.
- Sampler_Name: Chooses the sampler algorithm.
- Scheduler: Selects the scheduling method for sigma generation.
- Steps: Number of steps for the sampling process.
- Denoise: Denoising factor for adjusting the sampling intensity.
- Max_Shift and Base_Shift: Parameters for controlling the sampling shift.
- Guidance: Guidance factor for conditioning adjustments.
- Negative_Conditioning (optional): Additional conditioning for negative guidance.

Outputs:
- Model_Out: The processed model with applied sampling.
- Noise: The generated noise object.
- Sampler: The sampler object used for processing.
- Sigmas: The computed sigmas for the sampling process.
- Seed: The seed dictionary for noise generation.
- Latent: The generated latent image tensor.
- Guider: The guidance object for conditioning.
- Conditioning_Out: The adjusted conditioning tensor with applied guidance.
