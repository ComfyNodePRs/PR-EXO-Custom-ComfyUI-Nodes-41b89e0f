EXO Image Rescale Node ðŸ‘‘
-----------------------------
A versatile image rescaling node for ComfyUI that provides multiple scaling modes:

Modes:
- Ignore: Passes the image through without any modifications
- Resize: Resizes the image to specific width and height dimensions
- Upscale: Enlarges the image by a specified scale factor
- Downscale: Reduces the image by a specified scale factor

Features:
- Multiple resampling methods (lanczos, nearest, bilinear, bicubic)
- Supersampling anti-aliasing option for higher quality results
- Maintains proper tensor format for ComfyUI compatibility
- Configurable scale factors via external JSON configuration

Input Parameters:
- Image: Input image tensor
- Mode: Scaling mode selection
- Scale_Factor: Multiplier for upscale/downscale operations
- Resize_Width: Target width for resize mode
- Resize_Height: Target height for resize mode
- Resampling: Algorithm used for resizing
- Supersample: Anti-aliasing method selection
- Force_Resize: Option to force exact dimensions

Output:
- Processed image tensor in the correct format for ComfyUI (B,C,H,W)
