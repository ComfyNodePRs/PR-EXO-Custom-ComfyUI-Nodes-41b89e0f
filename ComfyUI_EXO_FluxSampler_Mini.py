"""
EXO FluxSampler Mini ðŸ‘‘
-----------------------------
The ComfyUI EXO FluxSampler Mini node is an sampling node designed for ComfyUI. It provides flexible sampling capabilities, allowing for control over model sampling.

Features:
- Model Sampling: Utilizes a custom ModelSamplingFlux logic.

Inputs:
- Model: The model to be used for sampling.
- Width and Height: Dimensions for the output image.
- Max_Shift: Parameters for controlling the sampling shift.
- Base_Shift: Parameters for controlling the sampling shift.

Outputs:
- Model_Out: The processed model with applied sampling.
